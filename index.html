  <h1>Interesting Facts About Me</h1> 
  </div>
    <p>I am Liliana Sanchez, currently attending Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago Illinois. I am a third year Information
    Technology major student. As a student my goal is to always be learning and acquiring new skills for any working environment. My major reflects
    very well my interest in making my career in the technological area. Most of my work experience has revolved around exploring my passion for 
    technology from hands on harware and software support. These jobs have also helped me learn the importance of practicing good customer service and communication.
    My current job requires multitasking between handling phone calls, answering emails, and helping cutomers walking in. It requires concentration and organization in order to 
    manage and handle the help request coming in. There is constant use of communication tools and a variety of softwares that is necessary to have knowledge of. This is my part time job on campus all while I 
    also attend class as a full time student. Although, this job can be stressful at times, I have learned to manage my time accordingly in order to balance my time between my studies, work, and personal life. 
    I enjoy my job very much and in time I aim to take this experience and skills to be employed in my developing career.
