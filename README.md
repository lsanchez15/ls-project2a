Project 2.


From its initial design from Project 1 my website has slowly been evolving. In project 2 I found it more useful to design a layout I could transition
across to all the web pages. I was also able to implement CSS3 into the design which was fun to play around with. I think my main challenge
with this project was to make the site work through the several screen sizes, which in the most part I was able to do. I definitely had to research
and read up on some of the concepts that were necessary to implement and understand for this project. I learned alot and now that I am a little bit more
familiar with the HTML and CSS im hoping to extend this site and have it really represent me and what I do and what I am passionate about.
Im proud of the work I was able to do with this project. Looking back to what it first started out as a drawing on a piece of paper to a black and white
web page and to have this now Im proud of it.I know it can still use some tweaks and fixing here and there but I like it.
The highlight of this project came when I was finally able to put up my site and see it live on the world wide web and go straight to my url. I then knew
that I had at least accomplished something with all my work. I hope to extend this project and in the future add more content
that will make this website unique from the rest.
